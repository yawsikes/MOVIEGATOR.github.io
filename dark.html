      <p>In 1975, eight-year-old Jean Grey is involved in a car crash while driving with her parents. They are both killed instantly, leaving her an orphan. Professor Charles Xavier takes her to Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, where he promises to teach Grey how to use her gifts for good.</p>

<p>In 1992, the X-Men respond to a distress signal from the Space Shuttle "Endeavour", which has been critically damaged by solar flare-themed energy. While saving the astronauts, Jean is struck by the energy. Miraculously, she survives the blast and absorbs the energy, saving her team's aircraft from destruction. However, as a result of the energy, her psychic powers are greatly amplified, and her emotional state begins to deteriorate, leading Raven Darkhölme to scold Xavier. As she becomes increasingly stressed, Jean's powers continue to become harder to control. She accidentally unleashes her power on mutants celebrating the victory in space at Xavier's school.</p>

<p>Xavier reveals to the rest of the X-Men that he had placed mental blocks in Jean's mind as a young girl to keep her from retaining her childhood trauma. Raven is shocked at Charles's revelation. Meanwhile, the mental blocks in Jean's mind are destroyed by her enhanced power and her childhood trauma slowly returns, filling her with rage and pain. She travels to her hometown after having visions of her father speaking to her.</p>

<p>Upon arriving, she finds her father alive; he had survived the car crash but forsook her afterwards. Jean recovers her complete memory of the car accident and realizes that, unable to control her powers at such a young age, she had accidentally rendered her mother unconscious at the wheel with her telepathy, inadvertently causing the crash that killed her. The realization that she is responsible for her mother's death causes her to develop post-traumatic stress disorder, and her powers spiral even further out of control. The X-Men arrive, and after a brief skirmish, Xavier pauses time to allow Raven to try to persuade Jean to come back home. However, Jean lashes out against Raven and blasts her away with her powers. Raven lands on shrapnel, which pierces through her body and kills her. Jean flees as Hank McCoy weeps over Raven’s body.
