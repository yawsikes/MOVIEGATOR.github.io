      <p>Years ago, Guy's parents get trapped in tar. As they sink into it, they tell him to find somewhere called 'tomorrow'. He goes on a long journey and meets a young Belt before eventually coming across Eep, leading to the events of the first film.</p>

<p>The Croods, along with Guy and their pets Chunky and Douglas, are still searching for a place to settle down, all the while Grug acts annoyed at Eep and Guy's blossoming romance. One night, Grug comes across a giant wall and leads the whole pack to it. They are soon caught in a net and are released by the owners of the land, a couple named Phil and Hope Betterman and they are soon revealed to be friends of Guy’s late parents and therefore, know Guy. The Bettermans welcome the Croods to their giant tree-home as house guests, where they meet their daughter and Guy's old friend Dawn who immediately befriends Eep. Life with the Bettermans becomes degrading for Grug due to the Bettermans being better evolved. Simultaneously, the Bettermans are revealed to have prejudice towards cave people and believe that Guy is better off with them because of his greater evolution, so they hatch a scheme to get Guy to hook up with Dawn and to leave the Croods. Phil eventually takes Grug to his secret man-cave, a sauna-like place</p>
 <p>behind the waterfalls, where he manipulates him into believing Guy should leave their pack, and Hope gets on Ugga’s bad side by demeaning her family’s nature as cave people. During this, Guy immediately becomes accustomed to life with the Bettermans, adjusting to their ways but unintentionally drifting from Eep in the process.
