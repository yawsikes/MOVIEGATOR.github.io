A CIA agent, the "Protagonist", participates in an undercover operation at a Kyiv opera house. His life is saved by a masked soldier with a red trinket, who "un-fires" a bullet through a hostile gunman. After seizing an artifact, the Protagonist is captured by mercenaries. He endures torture before consuming cyanide. He awakens to learn the cyanide was a test of his loyalty; his team has been killed and the artifact lost.</p>

<p>The Protagonist joins a secret organization called Tenet. A scientist shows him bullets with "inverted" entropy which allows them to move backwards through time. She believes they are manufactured in the future, and a weapon exists that can wipe out the past. Aided by a local contact, Neil, the Protagonist traces the bullets to arms dealer Priya Singh. He discovers she is a member of Tenet; her cartridges were purchased and inverted by Russian oligarch Andrei Sator.</p>

<P>The Protagonist approaches Sator's estranged wife Kat, an art appraiser who unknowingly sold Sator a forged Goya drawing. Sator uses the drawing to blackmail her and keep her under his control. The Protagonist plots to steal the drawing with Neil from a free port facility in Oslo Airport. There, they find a machine, a "turnstile", and fend off two masked men. Priya explains that the turnstile can invert the entropy of objects and people, and the masked men were the same person.</P>

<p>In the Amalfi Coast, Kat introduces the Protagonist to Sator, but learns the drawing is intact. The three go boating and Kat attempts to drown Sator, but the Protagonist saves him. The Protagonist offers to help Sator retrieve a case he says contains Plutonium-241. In Tallinn, the Protagonist and Neil ambush an armoured convoy and steal the case, which contains the artifact lost in Kyiv. They are ambushed by an inverted Sator, who holds Kat hostage. The Protagonist gives Sator an empty case and he retreats. The Protagonist saves Kat, but is captured and taken to Sator's warehouse.</p>
