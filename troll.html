Six Troll tribes represent the musical genres Techno, Funk, Classical, Country, Rock, and Pop. Each tribe keeps a magical string that powers their specific kind of music. Queen Barb of the Rock tribe summons all the tribes to a reunion, intending to steal the strings to unite the trolls under rock music after stealing the techno string.</p>
<p>
Queen Poppy, not knowing of this, takes their tribe's string and tries to 'unite the other trolls' with Barb, bringing along Branch, who is seeking to express his feelings towards her, and Biggie, a stowaway who was tempted by cotton candy. Cooper embarks on a quest to find trolls like himself, but a spaceship beams him up. He learns he is a lost prince of the Funk trolls, raised by the Pop tribe. En route to Volcano Rock City, the trio wind up in the ruins of Symphonyville, the Classical Trolls city, where a sentient flute named Pennywhistle fills them in on Barb's intentions. Determined to stop Barb's plans, Poppy leads the group to Lonesome Flats, the home of the Country trolls, in order to unite against her. After hearing how downbeat their music is, they try to cheer them up with a pop medley, but wind up in jail. Hickory, a smooth-talking Country troll, comes to their rescue and builds them a raft to take them to Volcano Rock City. On the way, they encounter Chaz, a Smooth Jazz troll bounty hunter sent by Barb to capture Poppy. Hickory blocks out the paralyzing smoothness of Chaz's music long enough to chase him off, but the incident prompts Biggie to leave due to his annoyance over Poppy casually leading them into danger.</p>
